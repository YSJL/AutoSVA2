We will start by defining properties and then the corresponding assertions to verify the behavior of the module. As the code defines behavior for a FIFO, our properties will revolve around correct FIFO functionality excluding the reset behavior:

1. If `in_hsk` is high, the buffer head pointer increments.
2. If `out_hsk` is high, the buffer tail pointer increments.
3. If `in_hsk` is high, the incoming data is stored at the head location.
4. If `out_hsk` is high, data from the tail of the buffer is read.
5. The output valid signal (`out_val`) should be high if there's any valid data in the buffer.
6. The input ready signal (`in_rdy`) should be low only if the buffer is full.

Now, let's write these properties:

```systemverilog
// SVA property file for fifo module

// Property 1: If in_hsk is high, buffer head pointer should increment.
property pr__increment_head;
    @(posedge clk) 
    in_hsk |-> (fifo.buffer_head_r == $past(fifo.buffer_head_r) + 1);
endproperty
as__increment_head : assert property (pr__increment_head);

// Property 2: If out_hsk is high, buffer tail pointer should increment.
property pr__increment_tail;
    @(posedge clk) 
    out_hsk |-> (fifo.buffer_tail_r == $past(fifo.buffer_tail_r) + 1);
endproperty
as__increment_tail : assert property (pr__increment_tail);

// Property 3: If in_hsk is high, incoming data is stored at the head location.
property pr__store_data;
    @(posedge clk) 
    in_hsk |-> (fifo.buffer_data_r[fifo.buffer_head_r] == in_data);
endproperty
as__store_data : assert property (pr__store_data);

// Property 4: If out_hsk is high, data from tail of buffer is read.
property pr__read_data;
    @(posedge clk) 
    out_hsk |-> ($past(out_data) == fifo.buffer_data_r[$past(fifo.buffer_tail_r)]);
endproperty
as__read_data : assert property (pr__read_data);

// Property 5: out_val should be high if there's any valid data in the buffer.
property pr__output_valid;
    @(posedge clk) 
    |fifo.buffer_val_r |-> out_val;
endproperty
as__output_valid : assert property (pr__output_valid);

// Property 6: in_rdy should be low only if the buffer is full.
property pr__input_ready;
    @(posedge clk) 
    (&fifo.buffer_val_r) |-> (!in_rdy);
endproperty
as__input_ready : assert property (pr__input_ready);

```

Note:
- `$past` is used to get the value of a signal in the previous clock cycle.
- The properties are written considering the FIFO operates in a clocked environment. 
- These assertions do not cover all corner cases but are a starting point for verifying the basic functionalities of the FIFO.
- Further refinement and additional properties may be needed based on the specific requirements and corner cases.
