Given the `fifo` module, the goal is to create SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) to check for the functionality of the module. 

Let's look at the key functionalities that need verification:
1. FIFO buffer is never written to if it is full (`in_rdy` is low).
2. FIFO buffer is never read from if it is empty (`out_val` is low).
3. FIFO buffer behaves as a circular buffer with head and tail pointers.
4. The data read from the FIFO is always the oldest data written to it (First In First Out).

With this understanding, let's draft some SVA assertions:

```systemverilog
module fifo
    #( /*... existing parameters ... */ )
    ( /*... existing I/O ports ... */ );

    //... existing module code ...

    //====================== SVA Assertions ======================

    // Assert that when 'in_rdy' is low, no handshake ('in_hsk') occurs.
    // This means no write transaction occurs when FIFO is full.
    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) !in_rdy |-> !in_hsk);

    // Assert that when 'out_val' is low, no handshake ('out_hsk') occurs.
    // This means no read transaction occurs when FIFO is empty.
    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) !out_val |-> !out_hsk);

    // Check the circular behavior of the FIFO pointers
    // Assert that if the buffer_head_r reaches the maximum value, it wraps around.
    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) 
                     (buffer_head_r == (INFLIGHT - 1)) && in_hsk |-> 
                     (buffer_head_r == 0));

    // Assert that if the buffer_tail_r reaches the maximum value, it wraps around.
    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) 
                     (buffer_tail_r == (INFLIGHT - 1)) && out_hsk |-> 
                     (buffer_tail_r == 0));

    // Assert the data out is always the oldest data written into the FIFO.
    // This is a bit tricky because FIFO works in a circular manner.
    // The data is checked against the oldest data at the tail pointer.

    always @(posedge clk)
        if (out_hsk)
            fifo.out_data == fifo.buffer_data_r[fifo.buffer_tail_r];

    // Ensure that the FIFO can store up to INFLIGHT number of items and no more.
    always @(posedge clk)
        $countones(fifo.buffer_val_r) <= INFLIGHT;

endmodule
```

Note:
- The SVA assertions will aid in checking the functional correctness of the `fifo` module.
- However, this is a high-level functional check. Depending on the specific requirements, additional assertions and/or more detailed verification might be necessary. 
- The final data check (FIFO property) is done using procedural code because comparing across multiple cycles using SVA properties is more complex and might need additional logic or state variables.
