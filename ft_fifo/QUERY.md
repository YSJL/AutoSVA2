To verify the correct functionality of the FIFO module, several assertions are needed. 

1. Check that if `in_val` is high and `in_rdy` is high, then the head of the buffer increments.
2. Check that if `out_val` is high and `out_rdy` is high, then the tail of the buffer increments.
3. Check that the data being pushed into the buffer (when `in_hsk` is true) matches the data at the head of the buffer.
4. Check that the data being popped from the buffer (when `out_hsk` is true) matches the data at the tail of the buffer.
5. Check that if the buffer is full (`in_rdy` is low), the head and tail positions are at their maximum distance apart (distance is equal to `INFLIGHT`).
6. Check that if the buffer is empty (`out_val` is low), the head and tail positions are the same.

Now, let's write the SVA assertions for the above:

```systemverilog
property as__PushCorrectness;
  @(posedge clk) in_val && in_rdy |-> fifo.buffer_head_r == $past(fifo.buffer_head_r) + 1;
endproperty

as__PushCorrectness : assert property (as__PushCorrectness);

property as__PopCorrectness;
  @(posedge clk) out_val && out_rdy |-> fifo.buffer_tail_r == $past(fifo.buffer_tail_r) + 1;
endproperty

as__PopCorrectness : assert property (as__PopCorrectness);

property as__PushDataCorrectness;
  @(posedge clk) in_hsk |-> buffer_data_r[fifo.buffer_head_r] == in_data;
endproperty

as__PushDataCorrectness : assert property (as__PushDataCorrectness);

property as__PopDataCorrectness;
  @(posedge clk) out_hsk |-> out_data == $past(buffer_data_r[fifo.buffer_tail_r]);
endproperty

as__PopDataCorrectness : assert property (as__PopDataCorrectness);

property as__BufferFullness;
  @(posedge clk) !in_rdy |-> (fifo.buffer_head_r - fifo.buffer_tail_r) == INFLIGHT - 1;
endproperty

as__BufferFullness : assert property (as__BufferFullness);

property as__BufferEmptyness;
  @(posedge clk) !out_val |-> fifo.buffer_head_r == fifo.buffer_tail_r;
endproperty

as__BufferEmptyness : assert property (as__BufferEmptyness);
```

Note that the above assertions assume that the buffer pointers will wrap around when they reach the maximum value (i.e., they will overflow from `INFLIGHT-1` to `0`). If this isn't the case, the assertions will need modifications.
