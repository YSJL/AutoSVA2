Given the code for a simple FIFO module, the module's primary functionalities are:

1. Buffer management: It should push data when `in_val` is high and `in_rdy` is also high, and pop data when `out_val` is high and `out_rdy` is also high.
2. Correct data storage and retrieval: The data written into the FIFO should be the same as the data read out.
3. The FIFO shouldn't accept new data when it's full and shouldn't produce data when it's empty.

Based on these functionalities, here are the SVA assertions:

1. **Empty and Full Conditions**: The FIFO shouldn't underflow or overflow.
    ```systemverilog
    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) out_hsk |-> |buffer_val_r);
    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) in_hsk  |-> !(&buffer_val_r));
    ```

2. **Pointer Update Consistency**: Buffer pointers should wrap around correctly.
    ```systemverilog
    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) 
                    (buffer_head_r + {{INFLIGHT_IDX-1{1'b0}}, 1'b1}) % INFLIGHT == buffer_head_r iff !in_hsk);

    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) 
                    (buffer_tail_r + {{INFLIGHT_IDX-1{1'b0}}, 1'b1}) % INFLIGHT == buffer_tail_r iff !out_hsk);
    ```

3. **Data Consistency**: If an item was added to the FIFO, the data should remain there until it's read out.
    ```systemverilog
    foreach (buffer_data_r[j]) begin
        assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
                        ($rose(add_buffer[j]) |-> (buffer_data_r[j] == in_data)));
        assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
                        (out_hsk && buffer_tail_r == j |-> (out_data == buffer_data_r[j])));
    end
    ```

4. **Data Validity on Output**: If `out_val` is high, then there must be at least one valid data in the FIFO.
    ```systemverilog
    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
                    out_val |-> |buffer_val_r);
    ```

5. **Data Ready on Input**: The `in_rdy` signal should reflect the fullness of the FIFO.
    ```systemverilog
    assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
                    in_rdy |-> !(&buffer_val_r));
    ```

6. **Buffer Clear and Add**:
    ```systemverilog
    foreach (buffer_val_r[j]) begin
        assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) 
                        add_buffer[j] |-> buffer_val_r[j]);
        assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
                        clr_buffer[j] |-> !buffer_val_r[j]);
    end
    ```

These assertions should help in validating the main functionalities of the FIFO module. However, one might need to adjust or add more assertions based on additional requirements or edge cases in the design.
