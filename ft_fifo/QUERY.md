SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) allow users to specify formal properties of a design. These properties are useful for verification, helping to ensure that design behavior matches the specification. For the provided FIFO design, we can write various assertions to check its functionality:

1. **In-Flight Buffer Counting**: We need to ensure that the FIFO doesn't overfill or underflow. 
2. **Data Integrity**: The data that comes out should be the same as the data that was input earlier.
3. **Handshake Mechanisms**: Check that `in_rdy` and `out_val` signals behave as expected.

Here's a list of SVA assertions for this FIFO:

```systemverilog
module fifo_sv_checks #(parameter INFLIGHT_IDX = 2, parameter SIZE = 4) (
    input wire clk, input wire rst_n,
    input wire in_val, input wire in_rdy, input wire [SIZE-1:0] in_data,
    output wire out_val, input wire out_rdy, output wire [SIZE-1:0] out_data,
    input [INFLIGHT_IDX-1:0] buffer_head_r, input [INFLIGHT_IDX-1:0] buffer_tail_r,
    input [2**INFLIGHT_IDX-1:0] buffer_val_r, input [SIZE-1:0] buffer_data_r [2**INFLIGHT_IDX-1:0]
);

// Ensure FIFO doesn't overfill
assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) (in_val && !in_rdy) |-> !(buffer_head_r + 1 == buffer_tail_r));

// Ensure FIFO doesn't underflow
assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) (out_val && !out_rdy) |-> buffer_tail_r != buffer_head_r);

// Ensure data integrity
int idx = 0;
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (in_val && in_rdy) begin
        idx = buffer_head_r;
    end
    if (out_val && out_rdy) begin
        assert (out_data == buffer_data_r[idx]);
        idx = (idx + 1) % (2**INFLIGHT_IDX);
    end
end

// Check handshake mechanism for input
assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) in_val && in_rdy |-> (buffer_head_r == (buffer_head_r + 1) % (2**INFLIGHT_IDX)));

// Check handshake mechanism for output
assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) out_val && out_rdy |-> (buffer_tail_r == (buffer_tail_r + 1) % (2**INFLIGHT_IDX)));

endmodule
```

A few things to note:

- `idx` is used to track the FIFO's write position to later check against the read position for data integrity.
- These assertions cover basic functionality but might not capture all corner cases. Depending on the requirements, additional assertions or modifications might be necessary.
- Some assertions use modulo (`%`) operation to ensure the buffer pointers wrap around when they reach the maximum value.
- Depending on the simulator and testbench setup, some of these assertions might need modifications or the addition of sequences to more accurately represent the expected behavior of the FIFO.
