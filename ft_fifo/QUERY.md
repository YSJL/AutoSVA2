Given the FIFO module description, the following SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) checks are defined to verify its behavior:

- **Full and Empty Conditions**: We want to ensure that when the FIFO is full, no new data can be written (`in_rdy` is 0) and when it's empty, no data can be read (`out_val` is 0).
  
- **Data Path**: Once the data is written into the FIFO (`in_hsk` is true), it should be available for read after it reaches the front (`out_hsk` is true).

- **Buffer Indexing**: We want to ensure that the `buffer_head_r` and `buffer_tail_r` pointers wrap around correctly once they hit the FIFO size (`INFLIGHT`).

Below are the SVA assertions in a property file format for the FIFO:

```systemverilog
module fifo_properties (input clk);

// Import the required fifo signals from the fifo module
import fifo::*;

//==============================================================================
// SVA Properties for the FIFO
//==============================================================================

// Check that when the FIFO is full, in_rdy is 0
property pr__fifo_full;
  @(posedge clk)
  &buffer_val_r |-> !in_rdy;
endproperty
as__fifo_full: assert property(pr__fifo_full);

// Check that when the FIFO is empty, out_val is 0
property pr__fifo_empty;
  @(posedge clk)
  !|buffer_val_r |-> !out_val;
endproperty
as__fifo_empty: assert property(pr__fifo_empty);

// Check that written data reaches the FIFO read
property pr__data_path;
  @(posedge clk)
  in_hsk |=> out_hsk within (INFLIGHT);
endproperty
as__data_path: assert property(pr__data_path);

// Check that buffer_head_r wraps around correctly
property pr__buffer_head_wrap;
  @(posedge clk)
  (fifo.buffer_head_r == (INFLIGHT - 1)) && in_hsk |-> fifo.buffer_head_r == 0;
endproperty
as__buffer_head_wrap: assert property(pr__buffer_head_wrap);

// Check that buffer_tail_r wraps around correctly
property pr__buffer_tail_wrap;
  @(posedge clk)
  (fifo.buffer_tail_r == (INFLIGHT - 1)) && out_hsk |-> fifo.buffer_tail_r == 0;
endproperty
as__buffer_tail_wrap: assert property(pr__buffer_tail_wrap);

endmodule
```

Note: These assertions capture key functionalities of the FIFO. Depending on the specific behavior and requirements of the design, additional properties may need to be defined.
